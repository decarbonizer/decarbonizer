# Contributing

While we don't have any plans up until this moment to actively continue developing Decarbonizer,
please feel free to fork this project, start a conversation via [discussions](https://github.com/decarbonizer/decarbonizer/discussions)
to ask questions or raise ideas,
create [issues](https://github.com/decarbonizer/decarbonizer/issues) or just generally try out the
application if you want to.<br/>

We are happy if this MVP actually sparks any kind of public interest by others and will be happy
to hear from you, one way or another! ðŸš€
