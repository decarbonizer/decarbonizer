# Decarbonizer

Decarbonizer is a web application which helps companies assess, plan and ultimately reduce their
global carbon footprint.

Decarbonizer has been created as part of the [SEBA Lab Course](https://web.archive.org/web/20220223132439/https://wwwmatthes.in.tum.de/pages/18witnulbiwl6/SEBA-Lab-Course)

## Goals and Context

As mentioned above, Decarbonizer was created as a student project at a university during one semester.
We had to give two graded presentations with live demos. Grading was done entirely based on the
presentation and thus the UI.
This means that our primary goal with the project and codebase was the following:

**✨ Develop a good looking, feature-rich _MVP_ which performs well during the demos. ✨**

**To summarize the point:** We tried to keep our codebase as clean as possible within the given
context, but naturally, there are rough edges and taken shortcuts which would have to be ironed out
before being able to transition from an MVP to a production version of Decarbonizer.

Examples of this are the (sometimes missing) authentication/authorization of endpoints,
code duplication, inexisting code documentation, etc.
Should there be any kind of public interest in this project, such issues would be good starting
points for improvement.
